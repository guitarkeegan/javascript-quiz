# Javascript Quiz

[Javascript Quiz](https://guitarkeegan.github.io/javascript-quiz/)

To help me study for technical interviews and practice building a quiz game.

## Description

This is a quiz app that has been completely built with vanilla javascript and only contains
front-end code. My goal was to make a quiz app that had a fun look and was easy to understand
without a lot of instructions.
